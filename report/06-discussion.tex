DQN turned out to be a very powerful method to learn Cart Pole. It was able to learn it quite quickly and small changes to the model didn't affect the learning that much. Only bigger changes in experience replay and $\epsilon$-greedy made it unstable. The same setup, unfortunately, didn't perform that well when the complexity of the task was increased from Cart Pole to Space Invaders.

We learned from this project that in modern reinforced learning the complex part is the network. Old reinforced algorithms work nicely when used correctly with modern deep learning methods.

To take this project further, we would implement a model with convolutional neural networks. Now when we understand every other part of the model, we can definitely implement that.
