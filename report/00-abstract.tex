\noindent{Our plan for this project was to explore neural networks, reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We set our focus on two algorithms: Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and their use to solve the OpenAI Gym environments. Initially, we selected Tennis on Atari 2600 as the environment to solve, but as we encountered difficulties that we originally didn’t expect, we had to try out our algorithms on other OpenAI Gym’s Atari 2600 environments.

While we didn’t exactly reach our initial goal: solving the Atari Tennis environment, we did manage to create working algorithms of policy gradient and DQN. The algorithms are able to solve the CartPole-v0 environment from OpenAI Gym. In the results section, we discuss the performance of both algorithms.
